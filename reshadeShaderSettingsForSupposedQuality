Observations about various Reshade shaders and some advice for them.
Reshade focused, but are applicable for other implementations.
Ensure the depth buffer is properly setup using DisplayDepth in Reshade.
Some settings may not be available.

"Less of a 'blur filter'" Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing FXAA # Supposed to remove aliasing or jagged / serrated / sawtoothed edges.
Subpixel aliasing removal / Subpixel anti-aliasing / fxaaQualitySubpix = "0.0" # Main cause of "over-smoothing". Set as low as tolerable.
FXAA_QUALITY_PRESET = "39" # Dithering, which occurs at lower settings, is more "grainy".
Edge detection threshold = "0.0" # Minimize to avoid "legacy" limitations. Lower settings are supposed to find and remove more aliasing.
Edge detection threshold minimum = "0.0" # "Minimize to avoid "legacy limitations". Lower settings are supposed to find and remove more aliasing.


"Higher quality" Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing SMAA # Supposed to remove aliasing or jagged / serrated / sawtoothed edges.
Corner rounding = "0.0" # Similar to subpixel aliasing removal in terms of smoothing.
color edge detection # Supposed to be more accurate. Supposedly weighted is even more so, at least over max.
Threshold = "0.0" # Similar to edge detection threshold / threshold minimum. Could be 0.05 as well.
Depth threshold = (0.1 * Threshold) # Similar to edge detection threshold / threshold minimum.
Search steps = Highest possible # Similar to edge detection threshold / threshold minimum. How much should aliasing be searched out? Higher settings means more searching but possibly lower performance.
Diagonal search steps = Highest possible # Similar to edge detection threshold / threshold minimum. How much should aliasing be searched out? Higher settings means more searching but possibly lower performance.
SMAA_USE_EXTENDED_EDGE_DETECTION = "1" # Might find and remove more aliasing.


Sharpening / Clarity # Recommended to use post-process anti-aliasing with these to balance.
Intensity / Strength Subjective # Controls the perceived sharpness. Lower settings usually result in less. Higher settings look sharper but with more of a "processed" appearance, artifacts, and imperfections might be more visible.


Inverse Tone Mapping / Advanced AutoHDR # According to my understanding expands an SDR application's capabilities to the peak brightness and colorspace of an HDR display but is not the same as a "proper" HDR implementation. Similar to RTX HDR. Use where HDR is not available but the display supports it. Must expose 16-bit with AutoHDR addon or dxvk. However, these methods are not expected to be "anti-cheat" friendly. Some shaders are incompatible such as sharpening and hdr compatible ones must be used such as hdr cas or rcas.
# Once AutoHDR addon or custom dxvk is installed and the app launches, customize the shaders. It may then appear washed out or over-exposed. If reshade warns about failing to compile such shaders, specify CSP_SCRGB or CSP_HDR10 in CSP_OVERRIDE.
# Some settings may be changed for "higher quality" or personal preferences.
# Use only one method at a time. So inverse or advanced only.

Inverse Tone Mapping
Target brightess = peak brightness of the display.
Input white point = SDR brightness of the app. # Usually will be 80-100 nits. SDR Brightness can usually be measured by using the SDR/HDR analysis shader alone.
Max input brightness = SDR brightness of the app. # Usually will be 80-100 nits. SDR Brightness can usually be measured by using the SDR/HDR analysis shader alone.

Advanced AutoHDR
Input Color Space = "Auto"
Output white level (paper white) nits = SDR brightness of the app. # Usually will be 80-100 nits. SDR Brightness can usually be measured by using the SDR/HDR analysis shader alone.
Output Color Space = "HDR scRGB" # scRGB is supposedly "higher quality" than HDR10.
Auto HDR method = "By luminance (color hue conserving) - RECCOMENDED"
Auto HDR target/max brightness = peak brightness of the display.


Ambient Occlusion / AO / Screen Space Global Illumination / SSGI / RTGI / SSRTGI / GI # Supposed to add "higher quality" lighting and shadow simulation.
# Most settings are subjective and possibly best left to default if unsure. 
# For RTGI, Launchpad must be setup first.
Fadeout / Fade-Out Range / Fade Out Distance = Highest possible. # Higher settings have more of the scene affected by the shader.
